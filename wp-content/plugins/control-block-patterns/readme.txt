== Notes ==
**Control Block Patterns** is the easiest way to design your layout with beautiful patterns and to insert code or script in your WordPress headers and footers.

Our goal is to make using WordPress easy, both with our WordPress plugins and resources like **SenseFlame**, the largest WordPress resource site for beginners.

We feel that we have done that here. I hope Control Block Patterns are useful to insert patterns and scripts on your site.
